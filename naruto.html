            ">Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen. .</div>

            ">Naruto's Prologue - Land of Waves arc covered the first 19 episodes of the show. Fans can fondly remember the series' debut, with Team 7's first serious mission leading them to encounter Zabuza and Haku—the most well-liked villains in the series.
            <br><br>
                This arc shows Team 7 getting into the first stages of understanding how serious being a ninja can be, as well as understanding that not every ninja is a clear-cut definition of "evil" and "good." Character growth begins immediately, as Zabuza ended up realizing what was truly important to him in the end.

            <br><br>

                From them attempting to figure out how to truly work together, to participating in near-death battles in the Forest of Death, nearly all of Naruto's characters proved their strength in this arc. The Chunin Exams Arc marked the first appearance of Orochimaru, fully displayed all of the Kohona 11, and introduced Gaara, Temari, and Kankuro</div>

            ">Before the Chunin exams could even get into their final stages, Orochimaru attacked the Hidden Leaf. The Konoha Crush Arc saw Hiruzen, the Third Hokage, and his pupil battled to the death.
            <br><br>
            Although Hiruzen's death was ultimately in vain, the impact it left on the characters—and especially Naruto—could be felt throughout the village. The events of the Konoha Crush Arc helped kick off the following arc, and indeed the entire rest of the Naruto anime.

It was later adapted into two Shippūden episodes: 119 and 120. This arc explores how Kakashi Hatake gained his Sharingan. In the manga, it is preceded by the Sasuke Recovery Mission and followed by the Kazekage Rescue Mission.

From the battle against Sasori, Sakura, and Lady Chiyo to Naruto trying desperately to rescue his friend, the first story arc kicked off Naruto Shipudden was memorable.</div>

            Meanwhile, Sasuke attacks Deidara and Tobi. Although he strikes Tobi, the attack has no effect. Deidara counters with his clay explosives, but Sasuke deflects them with his Chidori Senbon. Deidara decides to give his C2 a try.

Itachi turned out not to be as big as a villain the story led others to believe. In truth, he was manipulated into destroying his village in a tragic turn of events.</div>
