Though they seem like just simple-minded, rude, and hyperactive hotheads, there's a lot of complex layers to them. On top of their potential for deep, powerful storytelling in their undying determination, fighting-against-the-world narratives, they also serve as a fantastic source of neurodivergent representation.<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2023-02-13/powerful-weirdos-seeing-my-neurodivergence-in-shonen-protagonists/.193670" target="_blank"><span>....Read More</span></a></div>

			<div class="write">It may not seem practical for an anime character to announce their attacks before performing them. After all, it's basically like advertising their next move to their opponent. If their foe has previously seen the attack, it's not much of a surprise. Nonetheless, calling out one's attacks is one of the most common tropes in anime, especially battle shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia. It almost seems like announcing the attack names makes the attacks themselves more powerful or effective.<a href="https://www.cbr.com/why-anime-characters-announce-attacks/" target="_blank"><span>....Read More</span></a></div>

			<div class="write">The world of shonen anime has a handful of well-established storytelling tropes and recurring themes, from the virtue of never giving up to the power of friendship and being rewarded for hard work. Usually, the young protagonists embody these noble traits, while their adult mentors and teachers may directly or indirectly guide them in that direction.One example is the concept of a competitive examination, where each competitor is told to look out for themselves to score points and win. On the face of it, shonen students are being pitted against one another, but as many recent shonen titles have shown, the competition is just an illusion.<a href="https://www.cbr.com/shonen-anime-challenges-secret-combat-exams-teamwork/" target="_blank"><span>....Read More</span></a></div>

			<div class="write">When the original Pokémon Red and Blue came out, players had two main objectives for completing the game. The first objective was to catch, train, and battle with Pokémon to become Champion. The second objective was to capture all available Pokémon and complete the Pokédex. While the first goal was thoroughly covered by Ash in the anime, the second goal was left largely unattended.For whatever reason, neither Ash nor his travel companions were focused on capturing Pokémon until Goh was introduced. Yet his first appearance was two decades into the anime's run, approaching the end of Ash's adventures.<a href="https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-goh-introduced-new-goal-collecting-all/" target="_blank"><span>....Read More</span></a></div>

			<div class="write">Whenever someone asks a Pokémon fan why Ash never evolved his Pikachu, a couple of answers come up. At the end of the day, the Pokémon anime is an advertisement for the games. This not only means showing off characters and story elements from the games, but also certain mechanics for how the games are meant to be played.It teaches players these kinds of lessons while also entertaining them with compelling stories.<a href="https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-why-ash-pikachu-didnt-evolve-real-reason/" target="_blank"><span>....Read More</span></a></div>
